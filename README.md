  ## Usage
In order to kick off the application, the user must run the command "node index.js" in the terminal. From here the user will be prompted with a series of questions about the manager. Once they have filled out all of the manager's information, They will be asked to either add an inter or an engineer. They can add as many of both of these as they would like. Once they say no to adding another 
employee, the html file will be generated and can be opened in the browser.
